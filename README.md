## **Project Title**  
**Walmart Sales Analysis Using Python and SQL**

---

## **Description**  
This project involves analyzing Walmart's sales data using SQL to extract meaningful insights and provide data-driven solutions for improving business operations. The dataset contains information such as branches, payment methods, product categories, revenue, ratings, and transactions, which are utilized to identify trends, patterns, and areas of improvement.

The analysis includes data exploration, manipulation, and visualization of key metrics like payment preferences, branch performance, category profitability, and revenue trends. The project demonstrates the use of SQL queries for efficient data handling and insights generation.

## **Features**  
- Data exploration using SQL and Python.  
- Data cleaning and manipulation to prepare the dataset for analysis.  
- Analysis of transaction trends, revenue patterns, and category performance.  
- Insights into customer behavior and branch-specific statistics.  
- Year-over-year revenue comparisons to identify declining branches.

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **SQL**: For querying and analysis.  
- **Python**: For data manipulation and preparation.  
- **MySQL Workbench**: For database management and execution of SQL queries.  
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning and exporting the dataset to MySQL.

## **Dataset**  
The dataset includes transactional data from Walmart branches and covers:  
- Branch and location details.  
- Product categories and ratings.  
- Payment methods and quantities sold.  
- Revenue, profit margins, and timestamps.

## **Setup and Installation**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/walmart-sales-analysis.git
   ```  
2. Install the required Python libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas pymysql sqlalchemy
   ```  
3. Set up MySQL Workbench and create a database to store the dataset.  
4. Load the cleaned dataset into MySQL using the provided scripts.  
5. Run the SQL queries in the project to perform the analysis.

---

## **Analysis Performed**  
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and identify cleaning needs.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted data types for analysis.  
3. **Payment Analysis**: Determined the most popular payment methods and transaction counts.  
4. **Branch Performance**: Identified the best-rated categories and busiest days for each branch.  
5. **Profitability**: Calculated revenue and profit margins for each product category.  
6. **Year-over-Year Analysis**: Compared branch revenues for 2022 and 2023 to highlight underperforming branches.

---

## **Key Insights**  
- **Payment Method Trends**: The most commonly used payment methods can be leveraged for targeted marketing.  
- **Branch-Specific Analysis**: Branches with the highest ratings and busiest days were identified for optimization.  
- **Profitability**: Categories contributing the most to revenue and profit were highlighted for scaling operations.  
- **Revenue Trends**: Branches with declining revenue year-over-year were flagged for further investigation.

---

## **Future Scope**  
- Automating the analysis with Python scripts for periodic updates.  
- Incorporating advanced visualization tools such as Tableau or Power BI for better reporting.  
- Expanding the dataset to include customer demographics for more personalized insights.  
- Integrating machine learning models to predict future sales trends.
